Generic installation instructions for AUTOSTRUCTURE version 24.x.
                                      *************
 
An f95 compiler is required - see for example:

SUN/Oracle (Linux) Recommended
 http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solarisstudio/downloads/index-jsp-141149.html

gfortran (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)
 http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries

Intel (Linux)
 http://software.intel.com/en-us/non-commercial-software-development

Currently, g95 is not recommended.


There is (almost) no machine dependent code. The source here is REAL*8.

The dimensions are INCLUDEd from the file PARAM.
It should suffice for most use(r)s.


1. Compile AUTOSTRUCTURE (note PARAM must exist in the same directory):

f95 asdeck.f -o aslm.x

Use any optimization flags that you would normally use e.g. -fast.
Note: no libraries are required.

2. Execute AUTOSTRUCTURE

aslm.x <data

The file data should contain the UNIT5 data as discussed in WRITEUP.
Sample datasets are included in the /data sub-directory along with this file.


P.S. pasdeck.f is the parallel (f95) version.
